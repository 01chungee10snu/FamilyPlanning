# Feature Specification: Data Corrections for PDF Source Alignment

**Feature Branch**: `004-data-corrections`
**Created**: 2024-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@edit.md ÎÇ¥Ïö© Ï∞∏Ï°∞ÌïòÏó¨ Íµ¨Ï≤¥Ìôî"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse edit.md for data discrepancies
   ‚Üí Extract 5 slide corrections needed
2. Backup index.html before modifications
   ‚Üí Create timestamped backup file
3. For each data correction:
   ‚Üí Locate slide in index.html
   ‚Üí Apply correction from edit.md
   ‚Üí Maintain visual elements
4. Enhance presentation quality
   ‚Üí Apply color concept improvements
   ‚Üí Optimize layout and readability
5. Validate corrections against main.pdf
   ‚Üí Verify numerical accuracy
   ‚Üí Check citation completeness
6. Run validation tests
   ‚Üí Data accuracy checks
   ‚Üí Visual consistency verification
7. Return: SUCCESS (corrections applied)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT data needs correction and WHY it must match PDF source
- ‚úÖ Preserve existing functionality while correcting data
- ‚ùå Avoid changing structural elements beyond data corrections
- üë• Written for accurate academic presentation requirements

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a presenter delivering the "Family Planning: The Unfinished Agenda" presentation, I need the displayed data to exactly match the original Lancet 2006 paper (main.pdf) so that my presentation maintains academic integrity and credibility.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the presentation is loaded, **When** viewing Slide 3 (Global Population Trends), **Then** Asia statistics should show only total population (3,905M in 2005, 5,217M in 2050) without regional breakdowns
2. **Given** the presentation is loaded, **When** viewing Slide 4 (Niger Crisis), **Then** population should show 14 million (2005), contraceptive use 4.6% (1998), and 50 million projection for 2050
3. **Given** the presentation is loaded, **When** viewing Slide 5 (Kenya and Brazil), **Then** Brazil TFR should show change from 6.2 to 2.5 (not 2.3)
4. **Given** the presentation is loaded, **When** viewing Slide 6 (Bangladesh vs Pakistan), **Then** Pakistan contraceptive use should show 12% in 1990 (not 30%)
5. **Given** the presentation is loaded, **When** viewing Slide 10 (Unmet Demand), **Then** should include qualitative insights about spacing vs limitation needs in Africa, and wealth disparities in Asia/Latin America

### Edge Cases
- What happens when source data requires additional context notes?
- How does system handle statistical ranges vs exact values?
- How are rounding differences from the source handled?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create a backup of index.html before applying any modifications
- **FR-002**: System MUST correct Niger statistics to show 14 million population (2005), 4.6% contraceptive use, and 50 million projection
- **FR-003**: System MUST update Brazil TFR endpoint from 2.3 to 2.5 in success stories
- **FR-004**: System MUST correct Pakistan contraceptive rate to 12% for 1990 baseline
- **FR-005**: System MUST simplify Asia statistics to show only total population figures without sub-regional breakdown
- **FR-006**: System MUST add qualitative insights to unmet demand slide regarding spacing vs limitation and wealth disparities
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve all existing visual elements, animations, and color schemes except where ColorConcept.png improvements apply
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain exact numerical fidelity to main.pdf source document
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure all corrections are clearly traceable to specific pages/tables in main.pdf

### Key Entities
- **Slide Data**: Statistical values, years, percentages that must match PDF source exactly
- **Regional Statistics**: Population figures, TFR values, contraceptive usage rates by country/region
- **Source Citations**: References to specific tables, panels, and figures in main.pdf
- **Visual Elements**: Existing charts, maps, and design elements to be preserved
