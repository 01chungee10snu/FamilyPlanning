## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a presenter discussing family planning challenges, I need a slide that clearly communicates the current crisis in international support, funding gaps, and regional challenges (especially in Africa) so that the audience understands why urgent action is needed despite the proven benefits.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the presenter is discussing successful family planning cases, **When** transitioning to current challenges, **Then** a comprehensive slide shows the decline in international support and funding crisis
2. **Given** the audience has seen the benefits of family planning, **When** viewing the challenges slide, **Then** they understand why progress has stalled in certain regions
3. **Given** the slide contains multiple data points, **When** displayed on screen, **Then** the information is organized in a clear visual hierarchy that's readable from a distance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the slide has too much text for comfortable reading?
- How does the slide maintain impact without becoming overwhelming?
- How to balance negative messaging with the overall positive tone?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST add one new slide summarizing critical challenges from edit.md
- **FR-002**: Slide MUST include three main themes: funding decline, Africa/poverty challenges, and unmet needs
- **FR-003**: Slide MUST be positioned logically in the presentation flow (suggested: after success stories, before solutions)
- **FR-004**: Content MUST be visually organized with clear hierarchy (headings, bullet points, data visualization)
- **FR-005**: Slide MUST maintain consistent styling with existing presentation (colors, fonts, layout)
- **FR-006**: Key statistics MUST be prominently displayed (e.g., 30% unmet need in 9 African countries)
- **FR-007**: Slide MUST include source attribution to maintain academic credibility
- **FR-008**: Content MUST fit within single slide without requiring scrolling
- **FR-009**: Visual elements MUST support rather than distract from the crisis message

### Key Entities
- **Funding Crisis Data**: International support decline statistics, MDG exclusion impact
- **Regional Challenges**: Africa-specific data, population growth projections (Niger example)
- **Unmet Needs Statistics**: Percentage of women with unmet contraceptive needs by region
- **Timeline Elements**: 1994 Cairo Conference to present decline trajectory
