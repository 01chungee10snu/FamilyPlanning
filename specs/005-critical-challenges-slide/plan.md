## Summary
Add a single comprehensive slide summarizing critical challenges in family planning funding and support, positioned after success stories to provide contrast and urgency. The slide will use visual hierarchy and data visualization to communicate the funding crisis, Africa challenges, and unmet needs while maintaining presentation flow and academic credibility.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6
**Primary Dependencies**: Chart.js 4.4.0 (CDN), Leaflet.js 1.9.4 (CDN)
**Storage**: N/A (all data inline)
**Testing**: Browser-based visual validation
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge 100+)
**Project Type**: Single-file HTML presentation
**Performance Goals**: <3s load time, smooth transitions, readable from distance
**Constraints**: Single slide, 16:9 aspect ratio, 30-40 seconds viewing time
**Scale/Scope**: One slide addition to ~13 slide presentation

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Single-File Architecture ✓
- Slide will be added inline to existing index.html
- All styles and scripts embedded
- No external dependencies beyond existing CDNs

### II. Data-Driven Visualization ✓
- Key statistics (30% unmet need, funding decline) will be visualized
- Timeline visualization for funding decline 1995-2003
- Geographic heat map for Africa crisis regions

### III. 16:9 Presentation Format ✓
- Slide maintains strict 16:9 aspect ratio
- Responsive within ratio constraints
- Content scaled for projection viewing

### IV. Time-Series Geographic Integration ✓
- Africa crisis data shown with temporal progression
- Niger population projection visualized over time
- Regional unmet needs with timeline context

### V. 20-Minute Presentation Scope ✓
- Single slide addition (~30-40 seconds)
- Fits within existing presentation flow
- Does not exceed time constraints

### Source Code (repository root)
```
# Single project structure (HTML presentation)
index.html               # Main presentation file (update only)
```

**Structure Decision**: Single-file HTML - all changes to index.html only

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Research completed**:
   - Optimal slide placement determined (after slide 5)
   - Visual hierarchy patterns identified
   - Data visualization approaches selected
   - Color scheme for crisis messaging chosen

2. **Key findings consolidated**:
   - Three-panel layout for main themes
   - Timeline visualization for funding decline
   - Heat map for Africa challenges
   - Statistical callouts for unmet needs

3. **Design decisions made**:
   - Warning color palette (oranges/reds) for crisis
   - Icon-based section headers for quick scanning
   - Progressive disclosure of statistics

**Output**: research.md with all design decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Data model defined** → `data-model.md`:
   - ChallengeData entity with funding, regional, and unmet need properties
   - Visualization configurations for charts and maps
   - Timeline data structure for funding decline

2. **Visual contracts established** → `/contracts/`:
   - Layout contract: Three-panel responsive grid
   - Color contract: Crisis palette specification
   - Typography contract: Hierarchy and sizing
   - Animation contract: Transition timings

3. **Validation criteria defined**:
   - Content fits within single slide
   - All statistics sourced and attributed
   - Visual hierarchy guides attention
   - Maintains narrative flow

4. **Test scenarios extracted**:
   - Slide displays correctly at 16:9 ratio
   - Data visualizations render properly
   - Transitions work smoothly
   - Content readable from distance

5. **CLAUDE.md updated**:
   - Added critical challenges slide context
   - Updated slide count and flow
   - Recent changes documented

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, validation criteria, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Backup current index.html
- Locate insertion point (after slide 5)
- Create slide HTML structure
- Add data visualization JavaScript
- Implement chart configurations
- Add CSS styling
- Update slide navigation
- Test visual hierarchy
- Validate data accuracy
- Check timing and flow

**Ordering Strategy**:
1. Backup and setup tasks
2. HTML structure creation
3. Data integration tasks
4. Visualization implementation
5. Styling and polish
6. Testing and validation

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered tasks focusing on single slide addition

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (add slide to index.html)
**Phase 5**: Validation (visual testing, timing check, data verification)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations - all constitutional principles satisfied*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
