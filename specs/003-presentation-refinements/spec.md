# Feature Specification: Presentation Refinements and Data Validation

**Feature Branch**: `003-presentation-refinements`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "edit.md Ïùò ÎÇ¥Ïö©ÏùÑ Ï∞∏Í≥†ÌïòÏó¨ Íµ¨Ï≤¥Ìôî"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Edit.md contains detailed presentation refinement requirements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: slide modifications, data validation, citation formatting, UI fixes
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked specific data sources needing verification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow established for presentation viewing and interaction
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Created 12 testable requirements for presentation improvements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Slides, citations, visualizations, navigation elements
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Some data sources need clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a presentation viewer, I want to see accurate data with proper citations and smooth navigation, so that I can understand the family planning research findings with confidence in the data's validity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the presentation is loaded, **When** viewing any slide, **Then** page numbers display in format "current/total" at the bottom
2. **Given** slide 1 is displayed, **When** viewing the title, **Then** "Family planning: The unfinished agenda" appears in white text with proper APA citation
3. **Given** slide 3 map is displayed, **When** hovering over data points, **Then** tooltips stay within map boundaries
4. **Given** any data visualization, **When** source is unavailable, **Then** the element is not displayed
5. **Given** slide 4 is shown, **When** viewing Niger data, **Then** TFR shows as 7.5 (1998) with complete demographic projections
6. **Given** slide 5 is displayed, **When** viewing country comparisons, **Then** Kenya and Brazil flags are visible, Iran/Thailand are not

### Edge Cases
- What happens when PDF source data cannot be verified? ‚Üí Element is removed from slide
- How does system handle missing citations? ‚Üí In-text citation required or content removed
- What if mouse hover tooltip exceeds boundaries? ‚Üí Tooltip repositioned to stay within container

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display current page and total page numbers at bottom of screen
- **FR-002**: Slide 1 MUST show title "Family planning: The unfinished agenda" in white color
- **FR-003**: Slide 1 MUST display citation in full APA format for Cleland J, et al, Lancet 2006
- **FR-004**: All data visualizations MUST include in-text citations from verified sources
- **FR-005**: Mouse hover tooltips MUST remain within their container boundaries
- **FR-006**: Slide 3 regional growth table MUST contain complete data from PDF source
- **FR-007**: Slide 4 MUST display Niger TFR as 7.5 (1998) with population projections for 2050
- **FR-008**: Slide 5 MUST show Kenya and Brazil country flags, excluding Iran and Thailand
- **FR-009**: Slide 6 MUST include validated Bangladesh/Pakistan TFR comparison with citations
- **FR-010**: Slide 7 MUST explain MDG concepts and family planning relationships with sources
- **FR-011**: Slide 8 maternal/infant health data MUST use verified figures only ("nearly 10%" not 20%)
- **FR-012**: Slide 9 MUST include South Korea case study from Panel 4 of source PDF
- **FR-013**: Slide 10 (education-fertility correlation) MUST be removed entirely
- **FR-014**: System MUST remove any data element where source cannot be verified

### Data Validation Requirements
- **FR-015**: Kenya TFR MUST show initial value of 8.0 (not 7.8)
- **FR-016**: Kenya contraceptive use MUST show rise from 7% to 27% (not 41%)
- **FR-017**: Niger unmet contraceptive need MUST display as 17% with 56% having no future intent
- **FR-018**: Population dividend content MUST reference [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific East Asia economic growth percentage source]
- **FR-019**: MDG content MUST include [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific MDG-family planning exclusion documentation source]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Slide**: Presentation unit containing title, content, visualizations, and citations
- **Citation**: Source reference in APA format (full reference and in-text)
- **Visualization**: Maps, charts, or tables with verified data and hover interactions
- **Country Data**: TFR values, contraceptive rates, population projections with temporal context
- **Navigation Element**: Page counter showing current position in presentation
